# ApnNotes-React-App

- Developed ApnaNotes, a cloud-based notebook application, using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend.
- Utilized the latest features of ReactJS, including functional components, React Hooks, and state management using the Context API and Redux, to create a responsive and dynamic user interface.
