# ApnaNotes-React-App

- Developed **ApnaNotes**, a **cloud-base**d notebook application, using ReactJS for the frontend and NodeJS for the backend.
- Utilized the latest features of **ReactJS**, including functional components, **conditional rendering**, **React Hooks**, and state management using the **Context API** and **Redux**, to create a responsive and dynamic user interface.
-  Implemented backend logic for RESTful API, including designing and developing endpoints that interact with the **MongoDB database** using the **Mongoose library**, handling data validation, **JWT**-based **authentication**, and **authorization** using **JSON Web Tokens**, ensuring fast and efficient communication between the frontend and backend.
- Implemented security measures to protect user data by using **bcryptJS** to securely store user passwords in the database.

# The application has the following features:

- User can create an account with the application.
- User can log in and sign up by authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- Users can perform CRUD operations on their notes, such as creating new notes, editing existing notes, and deleting notes.
- Users can view their specific private notes, ensuring the security and privacy of their notes.

# ApnNotes provides users with an easy-to-use interface that allows them to create and manage their notes efficiently.

- The application is cloud-based, which means users can access their notes from anywhere and on any device with an internet connection.
- ReactJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB ensure the application is scalable, reliable, and secure.

# ApnaNotes is an ideal application for individuals who want to manage their notes online, making it easy to organize their thoughts and ideas.
